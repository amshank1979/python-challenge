DESCRIPTION:
# Challenge 3

There should be two sets of data, PyBank and PyPoll.  There are a couple of extra folders that I can't get rid of for some reason, but the 2 required folders (and their subfolders) are there.  

I would like to credit my tutor Steve Thomas, my classmate Bryan Johns, my instructor Justin and the Ask BCS team for their assistance with this.

If this README isn't what graders are looking for, please let me know how I can improve this content.

Thanks and have a nice night.
